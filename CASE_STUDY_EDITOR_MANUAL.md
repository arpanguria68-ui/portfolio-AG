# Case Study Editor Manual

## Overview
The Case Study Editor is a powerful tool for creating detailed, modular project pages. It features a split-screen layout with a real-time preview and supports various content types.

## Features

### 1. Modular Sections
Unlike a simple text editor, this tool allows you to build your case study using distinct blocks:
- **Text Block**: Standard rich text areas for narratives (Problem, Solution, Results, etc.).
- **Video Embed**: Embed YouTube, Vimeo, or Loom videos by pasting the URL.
- **Figma Prototype**: Embed interactive Figma frames.
- **Miro Board**: Embed Miro whiteboards for brainstorming sessions.
- **Image Gallery**: Grid layout for project screenshots.
- **Files / Docs**: Attach PDF or other resource files.

### 2. Live Preview
The editor features a real-time preview on the right side.
- **Themes**: Switch between "Default", "Ghibli" (Serif/Warm), and "Modern Glass" (Dark/Blur) themes instantly to see how your content adapts.

### 3. Section Controls
- **Toggle Visibility**: Use the toggle switch on any section header to Hide/Show it without deleting the content. This is useful for drafting.
- **Reorder**: (Coming Soon) Drag and drop sections to rearrange the story flow.
- **Collapse/Expand**: Click the section header to collapse it, keeping your workspace tidy.

### 4. AI Helper (Simulated)
- **Suggest Content**: Click "AI Enhance" to get suggestions for better copy.
- **Auto-Format**: Use the toolbar to quickly format lists and headers.
